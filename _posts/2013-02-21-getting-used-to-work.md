Before I enter my current workplace, PT User Inspired, I mostly do freelance works. The thing about freelance work is that you have almost total freedom on how you approach your work. In my case? My approach was an utter disaster. I can't keep up with my own schedules because I alwasy have reasons for procastinating. The worst part is, my sleep schedule. I often sleep at 4 or 5 in the morning, scrambling to meet my deadlines, which is really really a bad example of time management.

Now, that I have finally worked on a steady 9 to 5 Job for almost two months, I am starting to get used to the routines. The most significant change is that now I sleep so early that I'm already asleep when my friends just got home from work (What a difference, I know I am terribly lucky). I am still struggling to keep myself awake in the day though, but I am getting used to it. My schedules are also becoming more manageable now, since I have those 9 to 5 schedule that I can focus my mind on completely. I guess I am getting used to this schedule now.
