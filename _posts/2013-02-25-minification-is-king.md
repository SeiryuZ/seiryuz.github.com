Oh procrastinations. I always have problem in dealing with this problem since, like, I can remember. It seems as if more and more work are being delayed, because it seemed so cumbersome, tiring, too much of a work, and just not fun. Lately, I've been thinking and reading on how to combat this afflictions.

Now, I'm kind of interested in trying to minify my work. I know minification is important in my line of works, especially with javascripts and css (Get it?), but I'm talking about a different kind of minification. I'm talking about how to chop up tasks, or works to become bite size chunks so that it become so trivial that I can finish it in 5 - 10 minutes.

If it's hard to imagine, let me go with a more concrete example. I am planning to write a blog about basic git. If I deal with the task now, as in not chopping up the tasks. I have to write the opening paragraph, I need to research on git commands, I need to relate all the commands with the real world scenario, I have to write suggestions, yada, yada, yada. It seems so much works that I guarantee, I will delay the blog post mutiple times.

Now imagine, if I minify these tasks so that I only have to write opening paragraph today, research on git commands tomorrow, relate all the comands with the real world scenario the day after tomorrow, and so on so forth. It's now become a bite sized chunks that I can spend 5 - 10 minutes working on it everyday. I think I won't be delaying the blog post if I can keep this up.

This is what happen with my blog posts. I am currently combating the sheer laziness of me, by minifying my works. My last two blogs are simply dead, because I always procrastinate. I will try to keep this one alive by minifying my posts, make simple short blog frequently as a training to keep my discipline on not procrastinate things and manage my works better.

On another note, I will be *really* writing about basic git soon. To make sure I don't procrastinate, I will be chopping up the post about git to several parts and deliver it on a consistent manner. Here's hoping that I can keep up with it, but since it's minified so much that it become so trivial, I don't think I will delay it. All in all, Minification is king!
